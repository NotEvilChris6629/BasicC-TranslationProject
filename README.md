# Basic C# Translation Project

This repo marks the start of my upskilling journey to translate some of my Unity-based programming into more traditional app/console-based programming. After only a few days of playing about, I learnt a lot of fundamental techniques, method usage and extra information about methods I thought I knew everything about - so this was enjoyable to me. It's always exciting to learn more about something you thought you understood!

## What is this?

This repo contains a project showcasing four mini console app activities:  
- A random dice-throwing mini-game with prizes  
- A subscription warning app  
- A fraudulent order searcher  
- A student exam grading app  

These four apps allowed me to explore various techniques for programming console applications. Below, Iâ€™ll share a bit about each one and what I learned along the way.

### Dice Mini-game

This mini-game began as a simple exercise that displayed text to the screen after generating random numbers between 1 and 6. Once the basic functionality was complete, I started experimenting with ways to make it more engaging by adding features like doubles and triple multipliers to the base score.

Originally, the user needed to score 14 or above to "win"; anything below meant losing. I then added a variety of silly prizes for when the player scored above or below certain thresholds. This helped me better understand the order of operations when working with nested IF statements.

After finishing the mini-game, I moved on to the other exercises, where I implemented ways to take user input using `Console.ReadLine()` and began offering the user options for what they wanted to do.

Once all the projects were complete, I revisited the mini-game and experimented with adding color to the console outputs. This deepened my understanding of how `Write()` and `WriteLine()` fundamentally differ, and how to color only certain words or parts of the output.
